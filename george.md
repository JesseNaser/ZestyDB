## About Me: George Ebaugh

![George](george.jpg)

My name is George Ebaugh, and I am a senior computer science major at Wayne State University. I have one older sister that lives in Chicago and I live at home with my parents which I commute from.

My hobbies are mostly gaming during the winter but I love to go outside when it gets warm. Exploring nature and taking photos of it has always been one of my favorite activities.

I'm looking forward to finally graduating in the fall and seeing what the future holds.
