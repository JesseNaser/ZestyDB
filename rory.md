## About Me: Rory Jolliff

![Rory](rory.png)

Greetings, my name is Rory Jolliff - and this is my 4th year at Wayne State. I am proficient in a number of programming languages, including: java, c++, and python.
I also play minecraft occasionally - although I am not particularly good at the combat of the game, and would prefer to build functional and decorative structures.
