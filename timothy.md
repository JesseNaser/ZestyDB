Hi! My name is Timothy Kosinski and I'm a 4th Year Computer Science Student at Wayne State University. Some of my current classes that I'm taking this semester are Mobile App Development, Software Engineering, and Database Management!

Some of my hobbies are working on my 1992 Mazda Miata that I daily drive, Riding Bikes, Fishing, and playing video games! One interesting fact about myself is that I used to have 8 cats at one point! I never thought this could be possible but it did!

Thanks for stopping by and reading my Bio!
